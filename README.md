# AskPDF Front end
> This project is a web application that allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions related to the content of the PDFs, and receive answers. The backend is built using FastAPI, with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities powered by LangChain and LlamaIndex. The frontend is designed using React.js, and the application uses SQLite for database management and stores uploaded PDFs in the local filesystem.

You can view the live AskPDF Demo at [Demo](https://files.fm/u/yeprfswn8t)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `public`: the folder to maintain public assets

Inside the `src` directory, the code is structured as follows:

- `components`: This directory will contain all the common component files, which can be reused throughout the project.
- `views`: This directory will contain all the domain-specific component files. Each domain will have a separate folder.
- `contexts`: This directory will contain all the context files.
- `services`: This directory will contain all the service files.
